## Problem statement I chose:
### 5. Online Remote Proctoring - (Education)
In online tests without proctoring, cases are often reported of impersonation and cheating. Students either ask someone else to take the test on their behalf or use methods of cheating like referring to a textbook, using smartphones or other devices to search for answers online or taking help from a friend. The two major concerns of the customer are cheating and student authentication. It ensures the candidate focuses on the test screen during the test; there is enough light in the room and checks for suspicious objects in video and background voice activity to red flag the test. It also uses face recognition to do student authentication.

Solution:
I am trying to create a chrome extension that when enabled detects the face of user via webcam and displays warnings when there are 2 persons in the feed or person is found using electronic device. Also detects if alt or control key is pressed.
